A heavily modified version of twnsnd's foobar ncmpcpp mod: http://twnsnd.deviantart.com/art/foobar-ncmpcpp-mod-289083149

Most colors can be changed from inside the options for the respective panel, but some are system dependant and can't be changed from within the program (probably not a problem).

The following components are used in the theme, and are required to use it:
Columns UI
Panel Stack Splitter
Channel Spectrum Panel
ELPlaylist
Lyric Show 3
WSH Panel Mod
